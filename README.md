# Credit-card-approval
Commercial banks often receive numerous credit card applications, but not all applicants are approved. Many applications are rejected due to reasons such as high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually reviewing these applications is tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming. However, with the help of machine learning, this process can be automated. We'll create a tool that predicts whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected based on various factors.

In this project, I conducted thorough data preprocessing to ensure quality, which included cleaning, managing missing values, and feature engineering to derive insightful patterns from the dataset. Subsequently, I employed a diverse set of algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods to train and refine the predictive model, aiming for the highest level of performance.
In this credit card approval project, I embarked on developing a resilient predictive model to evaluate the creditworthiness of applicants. Employing advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Through this project, I've delved into the realm of supervised machine learning classification tasks, particularly focused on predicting the approval or rejection of credit card applications based on feature variables. Exploring various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. I've gained insights into their workings and performance. Among these models, the Random Forest stood out with an impressive accuracy of 92%, emerging as the optimal choice for prediction. This hands-on experience has enriched my understanding of classification modeling and its application in real-world scenarios like credit risk assessment.
